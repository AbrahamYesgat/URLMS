In order to test our desktop application, assure that the data.xml file is in the output folder. If it is not, then run the JUnit tests first.
Then you can test the login for the two following accounts:
1. email = director@urlms.ca , password = password
2. email = staff@urlms.ca , password = password

Anything else will result in the a failed login.
