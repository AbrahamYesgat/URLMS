In order to test our android application, you must first run the J Unit tests in order to create a data file in the emulator. 
Then you can test the login for the two following accounts:
1. email = director@urlms.ca , password = password
2. email = staff@urlms.ca , password = password 

Anything else will reuslt in a failed login.
